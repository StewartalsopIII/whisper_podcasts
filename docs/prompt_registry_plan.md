## Technical Dependencies and Version Compatibility

### OpenAI Integration
- **Version Requirements**:
  - OpenAI package version 1.5.0 recommended
  - HTTPX version < 0.28.0 required (0.27.2 confirmed working)
  - Python 3.13 compatible

### Version Compatibility Notes
1. **Known Working Configurations**:
   - OpenAI 1.5.0 + HTTPX 0.27.2
   - Avoid HTTPX 0.28.0+ due to removal of 'proxies' argument

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Use explicit version pinning in requirements.txt
   - Test dependency upgrades in isolation
   - Document working configurations

3. **Troubleshooting Common Issues**:
   - HTTPX proxy configuration conflicts
   - OpenAI client initialization errors
   - Version mismatch resolutions

4. **Upgrade Guidelines**:
   - Test OpenAI package upgrades with compatible HTTPX versions
   - Document any breaking changes
   - Maintain backup of working configurations
