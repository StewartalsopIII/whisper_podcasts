# Next Steps: Implementing Timestamps Component

## Overview
Building on the newly created chunker system, the next major component to implement is the timestamps.py module which will generate 5-minute interval markers with discussion topics for the show notes.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. File Structure
Create new file:
```
prompts/registry/essential/show_notes/timestamps.py
```

### 2. Core Components

#### a) Constants and Prompts
```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert at creating podcast timestamps..."""

CHUNK_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Process this segment of transcript and identify key topics at 5-minute intervals..."""

FINAL_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Combine these timestamp segments into a coherent timeline..."""
```

#### b) Core Functions
1. Main Extraction Function:
```python
def extract_timestamps(client, transcript_text):
    """
    - Uses chunker for large transcripts
    - Processes each chunk while maintaining timestamp continuity
    - Returns assembled timestamp sections
    """
```

2. Results Processing:
```python
def compile_timestamps(chunk_results):
    """
    - Combines timestamp segments
    - Ensures sequential ordering
    - Resolves any overlap between chunks
    """
```

3. Output Formatting:
```python
def format_timestamp_section(timestamps):
    """
    - Creates markdown-formatted timestamp section
    - Ensures consistent formatting
    - Handles both HH:MM:SS and MM:SS formats
    """
```

### 3. Integration Points

#### a) Compiler Integration
- Update compiler.py to include timestamp generation
- Add timestamp section to final show notes format
- Handle errors and fallbacks

#### b) Chunker Usage
- Utilize existing chunker for transcript processing
- Maintain timestamp continuity across chunks
- Handle chunk transitions smoothly

### 4. Technical Considerations

1. Timestamp Handling:
   - Parse SRT format timestamps from transcript
   - Maintain 5-minute interval consistency
   - Handle transitions between chunks

2. Error Handling:
   - Missing timestamps
   - Invalid time formats
   - Chunk boundary issues

3. Performance:
   - Efficient chunk processing
   - Minimize API calls
   - Handle large transcripts effectively

### 5. Testing Plan

1. Unit Tests:
   - Timestamp parsing
   - Chunk processing
   - Output formatting

2. Integration Tests:
   - Full pipeline testing
   - Error handling verification
   - Format consistency checks

### 6. Next Actions

1. Create timestamps.py with basic structure
2. Implement core timestamp extraction logic
3. Add chunk processing integration
4. Update compiler for timestamp inclusion
5. Add tests and error handling
6. Test with various transcript lengths

## Timeline
- Initial implementation: 2-3 days
- Testing and refinement: 1-2 days
- Integration and documentation: 1 day
